# Anime Recommendation System
This repository contains a comprehensive Anime Recommender System built using Python and various machine learning techniques. The system aims to provide personalized anime recommendations to users based on their viewing history, preferences, and similarities with other users. It uses both Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering approaches to provide accurate and diverse anime recommendations.

## Key Features
1. **User-based Collaborative Filtering**
Recommends anime to users by finding other users with similar preferences and suggesting shows that those users have rated highly.
This method assumes that users who liked similar items in the past will continue to like similar items in the future.
2. **Content-based Filtering**
Recommends anime based on the characteristics of the anime (genres, themes, styles) that the user has watched and rated highly.
This approach focuses on the content features of the anime and suggests similar anime shows based on those features.
3. **Hybrid Approach**
Combines both User-based Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering for more accurate and diverse recommendations.
The hybrid approach mitigates the weaknesses of each individual method, providing better overall recommendations.
4.**Data Preprocessing**
Handles missing data, performs data normalization, and applies feature scaling techniques.
Ensures that the dataset is clean and suitable for training machine learning models.
Deals with missing or incomplete ratings by filling or ignoring them as needed.
5. **Model Evaluation**
Uses standard evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score to assess the quality of the recommendations.
Cross-validation techniques are applied to improve the robustness of the recommendation system.

## Dataset

The system uses a dataset from [insert dataset name, e.g., MyAnimeList, AnimePlanet], which contains the following information about each anime show:

**Titles**: The names of the anime.
**Genres**: Categories like action, adventure, fantasy, etc.
**Themes**: Thematic elements like romance, supernatural, slice of life, etc.
**User Ratings**: User-generated ratings for each anime.
**Viewing History**: The list of anime that each user has watched and rated.
This data is used for both training the recommendation algorithms and providing personalized recommendations to users.

## Technologies Used
**Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the recommendation system.
**Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
**NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
**Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and metrics (e.g., collaborative filtering, evaluation metrics).
**TensorFlow**: (if used) For deep learning-based recommendation models.
**Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing recommendation results and evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Anime Recommendation System:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required dependencies using pip. From the repository directory, run:



## Example Usage
After running the script, the system will prompt you for input (e.g., the name of an anime you like), and it will generate a list of recommended anime based on the methods mentioned above. Here's an example:

python

**# Example input
input_anime = "Naruto"
# System will recommend anime based on your input
recommended_anime = recommend_anime(input_anime)
print(recommended_anime)**
